 * Since the object has no guarantee to existence, all stateless (void) operations should be considered

 * If the library user needs objects that offer a more strong guarantee to existence, see ExistentRegistry.

 * It or it's inheritors typically do not expose any state.
 * Exceptions include things like exposing the internal object via lambda ifPresent or via an unsafe telescope, or
 * intrinsically existence-ignorant values like the object uuid.
