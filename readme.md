# OpenMinePlatform

> I've made waaay too many utility projects over the course of my spigot 
development career.

Half of them were designed improperly or were overcomplicated or bloated to the
point of not being useful. Why does beetle include data handling, randomizers,
messaging, scoreboards?

Writing a utility is striking a balance between necessity and desire.

Writing a java project correctly is making sure your package is specialized.

OpenMinePlatform simply provides platform-agnostic access to commonly written
abstraction layers over the minecraft platform. There are no database handlers,
no configuration systems, none of that belongs in OpenMinePlatform, since other libraries
are better specialized to handle those functions.

Very opinionated.
